## Core Concept: Snapshot-Based Portfolio Model

### Overview

AssetFlow tracks portfolio state through **snapshots** -- discrete records of portfolio holdings at specific dates. This differs from transaction-based systems that derive state from a history of buy/sell operations.

**Key Rules**:

1. Snapshots are append-only -- a new import never silently overwrites an existing snapshot
1. A snapshot contains only directly-recorded SnapshotAssetValues. There is no automatic carry-forward. Users can explicitly copy values from prior snapshots via "Copy from latest" (manual creation) or the copy-forward option during CSV import.
1. The CSV file does NOT contain a date -- the user explicitly selects a date when importing
1. Users may delete or edit snapshots after creation

______________________________________________________________________

## Calculation Logic

All calculations are derived from stored structured data. No spreadsheet-style hidden formulas. All portfolio-level metrics operate on stored portfolio values.

### Portfolio Total Value

For a given snapshot, the total value is the sum of all directly-stored SnapshotAssetValues, **converted to the display currency** using the snapshot's exchange rate:

```
total_value(snapshot) = sum(convert(sav.marketValue, from: asset.currency, to: displayCurrency) for each sav)
```

If exchange rate data is unavailable (e.g., offline), raw unconverted values are summed as a fallback. This value is always derived, never stored on the Snapshot model.

### Currency Conversion

Each asset and cash flow has a native currency. When computing cross-asset totals, values are converted to the global display currency using the snapshot's `ExchangeRate`:

```
converted_value = value / rates[from_currency] * rates[to_currency]
```

Where `rates[baseCurrency]` is implicitly 1.0. Cross-rate conversion is used when neither currency is the base currency.

**Graceful Degradation**: If exchange rate is nil or a currency is missing from rates, the original unconverted value is returned. This ensures the app works offline without crashing. An error banner is shown when rates cannot be fetched.

### Category Allocation

For each snapshot, asset values are converted to the display currency before computing allocation:

```
category_value = sum(convert(market_value, asset.currency, displayCurrency) for assets in category)
category_percentage = category_value / total_portfolio_value * 100
```

- Uncategorized assets appear as a separate "Uncategorized" group
- A category with no assets has allocation = 0%
- If all assets are uncategorized, the "Uncategorized" group shows 100% allocation

### Growth Rate

Growth rate measures the **simple percentage change** in portfolio value between two dates. It includes the effect of cash flows (deposits/withdrawals) and does NOT isolate investment performance.

```
growth_rate = (Ending_Value - Beginning_Value) / Beginning_Value
```

**Period Lookback**: For 1M, 3M, and 1Y growth:

1. Calculate the target lookback date (latest snapshot date minus 1/3/12 months)
1. Find the closest snapshot to the target date in either direction (before or after), with no distance limit
1. When two snapshots are equidistant from the target, prefer the earlier one
1. If fewer than 2 snapshots exist, return N/A

### Modified Dietz Return

The Modified Dietz method calculates investment returns, isolating actual performance by adjusting for the timing and magnitude of external cash flows.

**Formula**:

```
R = (EMV - BMV - CF) / (BMV + sum(wi * CFi))
```

Where:

- `EMV` = ending portfolio value
- `BMV` = beginning portfolio value
- `CF` = total net cash flow during the period (sum of CFi)
- `CFi` = net cash flow at each intermediate snapshot
- `wi` = time-weighting factor for each cash flow
- `wi = (CD - Di) / CD`
- `CD` = total calendar days in the period
- `Di` = number of days from period start to cash flow i

**Cash Flow Time-Weighting**:

Cash flows recorded on snapshot dates have known timing. For a return calculation over any period:

1. Identify all snapshots strictly after the begin date through the end date (inclusive)
1. Each snapshot's net cash flow (sum of its CashFlowOperation amounts) is a cash flow event at that snapshot's date
1. Weight each by how much of the period remained when it occurred

**Example**: 90-day period, cash flow of +100,000 at day 30:

```
w = (90 - 30) / 90 = 0.667
Weighted cash flow = 0.667 * 100,000 = 66,700 (added to denominator)
```

A cash flow at the very start (day 0) gets weight 1.0 (fully invested). A cash flow at the very end (day 90) gets weight 0.0 (not invested during the period).

**Period Lookback**: Same bidirectional closest-snapshot lookback as growth rate (no distance limit, prefer earlier on tie).

**Supported Levels**: Portfolio-level return only in v1. Category-level return is not tracked because category-level cash flow data is unavailable.

### Cumulative Time-Weighted Return (TWR)

Cumulative TWR chains Modified Dietz returns between consecutive snapshots to measure long-term portfolio performance:

For each consecutive pair of snapshots (S0->S1, S1->S2, ..., Sn-1->Sn), compute the Modified Dietz return `ri`:

```
TWR = (1 + r1) * (1 + r2) * ... * (1 + rn) - 1
```

This is the standard time-weighted return methodology that eliminates the distortion of external cash flows across the full history.

### CAGR

```
CAGR = (Ending_Value / Beginning_Value) ^ (1 / Years) - 1
```

Where `Years` = (end date - start date) / 365.25

Available for portfolio-level only in v1.

## Rebalancing Engine

The rebalancing calculator is **read-only** -- it computes suggested adjustments but does NOT modify stored data.

### Inputs

- Current category allocation (from latest snapshot)
- Target allocation (from category settings)

### Calculation

For each category with a target allocation:

```
target_value = total_portfolio_value * target_percentage / 100
adjustment_amount = target_value - current_category_value
```

### Output

A table showing:

| Category | Current Value | Current % | Target % | Difference ($) | Action       |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Equities | $75,000       | 60%       | 50%      | -$12,500       | Sell $12,500 |
| Bonds    | $25,000       | 20%       | 30%      | +$12,500       | Buy $12,500  |
| Cash     | $25,000       | 20%       | 20%      | $0             | No action    |

### Rules

- Only categories with target allocations are included in the main table
- Categories without targets are shown separately as "No target set"
- Uncategorized assets shown as a separate row with current value and current %, with "--" in Target % and "N/A" in Difference and Action
- Sort order: by absolute adjustment magnitude (largest deviation first)
- Minimum threshold: adjustments under $1 are displayed as "No action needed"

______________________________________________________________________

## CSV Import System

### Import Flow

1. User selects import type (Assets or Cash Flows) via segmented control
1. User selects a CSV file (drag-and-drop or browse)
1. System validates columns based on selected import type
1. User configures import parameters:
   - **Asset import**: Snapshot date (required, defaults to today), Platform (optional), Category (optional)
   - **Cash flow import**: Snapshot date (required, defaults to today)
1. Preview table shows parsed data with inline validation indicators
1. User may remove individual rows from the preview
1. User clicks "Import" to confirm
1. On success: snapshot created or updated; user navigated to snapshot detail

### CSV Schemas

**Asset CSV** (required columns: `Asset Name`, `Market Value`; optional: `Platform`):

```csv
Asset Name,Market Value,Platform
AAPL,15000,Interactive Brokers
VTI,28000,Interactive Brokers
Bitcoin,5000,Coinbase
Savings Account,20000,Chase Bank
```

**Cash Flow CSV** (required columns: `Description`, `Amount`):

```csv
Description,Amount
Salary deposit,50000
Emergency fund transfer,-10000
```

### Parsing Rules

- **Encoding**: UTF-8 (with BOM tolerance)
- **Delimiter**: Comma only
- **Number parsing**: Strip whitespace, currency symbols ($), thousand separators (commas in numbers). Parse as `Decimal`. Negative values allowed.
- **Empty rows**: Silently skipped
- **Header row**: Required as first row

### Validation

**Errors (block import) -- Asset CSV**:

- Missing `Asset Name` or `Market Value` column
- `Market Value` cannot be parsed as a number for any row
- Empty `Asset Name` for any row
- File is empty or contains only headers
- Duplicate entries detected (within CSV or against existing snapshot)

**Errors (block import) -- Cash Flow CSV**:

- Missing `Description` or `Amount` column
- `Amount` cannot be parsed as a number for any row
- Empty `Description` for any row
- File is empty or contains only headers
- Duplicate entries detected (within CSV or against existing snapshot)

**Warnings (allow import) -- Asset CSV**:

- `Market Value` is zero for an asset
- `Market Value` is negative for an asset
- Unrecognized columns (ignored but noted)
- Asset already exists with a different category than import-level selection

**Warnings (allow import) -- Cash Flow CSV**:

- `Amount` is zero
- Unrecognized columns (ignored but noted)

Each error/warning references the specific row number and column.

### Platform Handling

Platform for each asset is determined by the import-level platform selection and apply mode:

1. If no import-level platform is selected, use per-row CSV values (or empty if no `Platform` column)
1. If an import-level platform is selected:
   1. **Override All** (default): Every row receives the selected platform, overriding CSV values
   1. **Fill Empty Only**: Only rows whose CSV platform is empty receive the selected platform; rows with existing CSV platforms keep their original values

The apply mode toggle appears only when a platform is selected AND the CSV has a mix of empty and non-empty platform values.

### Duplicate Detection

Duplicates cause the **entire import to be rejected** -- no partial imports.

**Asset CSV duplicates**:

- **Within CSV**: Two rows with the same (Asset Name, Platform) after applying platform handling rules and normalized identity comparison
- **Between CSV and existing snapshot**: An asset in the CSV matches an asset already recorded in the target snapshot (same date)

**Cash flow CSV duplicates**:

- **Within CSV**: Two rows with the same Description (case-insensitive)
- **Between CSV and existing snapshot**: A Description matches an existing CashFlowOperation in the target snapshot

### Category Assignment During Import

- If user selects a category, ALL assets in the import are assigned to that category
- If no category selected, imported assets are uncategorized
- "New Category..." option: if entered name matches existing category (case-insensitive), the existing one is used; otherwise a new category is created with no target allocation
- If an imported asset already exists with a different category, the import-level category overrides (warning shown in preview)

______________________________________________________________________

## Category Management

### Operations

- **Create**: User provides name and optional target allocation. Also created implicitly via "New Category..." picker option. New categories receive the next sequential `displayOrder` value.
- **Edit**: Rename or change target allocation
- **Delete**: Only allowed if no assets are assigned. If assets exist, user must reassign them first. After deletion, `displayOrder` values are compacted to remove gaps.
- **Reorder**: Categories can be reordered via drag-and-drop. The `displayOrder` property persists the user-defined order. All category lists sort by `displayOrder` first, then alphabetically by name as a tiebreaker.

### Target Allocation Rules

- Target allocations across all categories should sum to 100% (app warns if not, but does not block)
- Categories without a target allocation are excluded from rebalancing calculations
- An "Uncategorized" virtual group appears in allocation views for assets without a category

______________________________________________________________________

## Asset Identity and Matching

### Identity Rule

An asset is uniquely identified by the tuple: **(Asset Name, Platform)**

- During import, if an asset with the same name and platform already exists, the existing asset record is reused
- If no match exists, a new asset record is created
- Matching uses normalized identity comparison (trim whitespace, collapse spaces, case-insensitive)

### Renaming Behavior

- Renaming an asset or changing its platform **via CSV import** creates a new asset (old one remains with historical values)
- Renaming an asset or changing its platform **via the Asset detail view** updates the existing asset retroactively across all snapshots. The new (name, platform) must not conflict with an existing asset.

### Asset Deletion

An asset can be deleted when it has **no SnapshotAssetValue records** in any snapshot:

- The asset was removed from all snapshots, or
- The asset was created but never used

When an asset has snapshot associations, the delete action is disabled with explanatory text. Deletion is permanent and requires confirmation.

______________________________________________________________________

## Snapshot Lifecycle

### Manual Creation

1. User clicks "New Snapshot" on the Snapshots screen
1. Selects a date (must be today or earlier, future dates disabled)
1. If the selected date already has a snapshot, show validation error: "A snapshot already exists for [date]. Go to the Snapshots screen to view and edit it."
1. Chooses starting point:
   - **Start empty**: Creates snapshot with no asset entries
   - **Copy from latest**: Pre-populates with all direct SnapshotAssetValues from the most recent prior snapshot. Disabled (grayed out with explanatory text) when no snapshots exist before the selected date.
     - Algorithm: (1) filter snapshots to those with date < selected date, (2) take the most recent one, (3) copy its direct SnapshotAssetValues as new records for the new snapshot
1. User is taken to snapshot detail for editing

### CSV Import Creation

Snapshots created through the CSV import flow. If a snapshot already exists for the selected date, SnapshotAssetValues are added to the existing snapshot.

### Editing

Within the snapshot detail view:

- **Add asset**: Select existing asset or create new one. Rejected if (Asset Name, Platform) already exists in this snapshot.
- **Edit value**: Click on market value to edit. Changes saved immediately. There is no undo for inline value edits. Users should verify values before moving to the next field.
- **Remove asset**: Remove a directly-recorded asset from this snapshot (asset record itself is NOT deleted)
- **Add/Edit/Remove cash flow**: Manage CashFlowOperations with description uniqueness check

### Deletion

- Confirmation required showing date, asset count, and cash flow count
- Removes the Snapshot and all its SnapshotAssetValues and CashFlowOperations
- Asset records are NOT deleted

______________________________________________________________________

## Net Cash Flow

### Purpose

Net cash flow represents external money added to or withdrawn from the portfolio between snapshots. It is needed for accurate Modified Dietz return calculation.

### Cash Flow Operations

Each snapshot contains zero or more CashFlowOperation records:

- **Description** (required, unique within snapshot) -- identifies the cash flow
- **Amount** (required) -- Positive = inflow, negative = outflow

Net cash flow = sum of all CashFlowOperation amounts for a snapshot.

### Input Methods

1. **CSV import**: Using the cash flow CSV schema. Duplicate detection applies.
1. **Manual entry**: On the snapshot detail screen. Description uniqueness enforced.

### Scope and Limitations

- Portfolio-level only in v1
- Category-level cash flow tracking deferred to future version
- Cash flow operations apply to entire portfolio regardless of which platforms were included
- All operations within a snapshot assumed to occur at the snapshot date for time-weighting

### Default Behavior

If a snapshot has no cash flow operations, net cash flow = 0, which assumes all value changes are due to investment returns.

______________________________________________________________________

## Data Validation Rules

### Category Validation

- `name` must not be empty
- `name` must be unique (case-insensitive)
- `targetAllocationPercentage`, if provided, must be 0-100

### Asset Validation

- `name` must not be empty
- `(name, platform)` must be unique (case-insensitive, normalized)

### Snapshot Validation

- `date` must be today or earlier
- `date` must be unique (one snapshot per date)

### SnapshotAssetValue Validation

- `(snapshot, asset)` must be unique (one value per asset per snapshot)
- `marketValue` must be a valid `Decimal`

### CashFlowOperation Validation

- `description` must not be empty
- `(snapshot, description)` must be unique (case-insensitive)
- `amount` must be a valid `Decimal`

______________________________________________________________________

## Error Handling

### Import Errors

| Error                                       | Handling                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File cannot be opened                       | Alert: "Could not open file. Please check the file is a valid CSV." |
| Missing required columns for selected type  | Show which columns are expected vs. found, block import             |
| Unparseable values                          | Highlight specific rows/columns, block import                       |
| No data rows                                | Alert: "File contains no data rows."                                |
| Duplicate assets in CSV                     | Error dialog listing duplicates with row numbers, import rejected   |
| Duplicate assets with existing snapshot     | Error dialog listing conflicts, import rejected                     |
| Duplicate cash flows in CSV                 | Error dialog listing duplicates, import rejected                    |
| Duplicate cash flows with existing snapshot | Error dialog listing conflicts, import rejected                     |

### Calculation Errors

- Division by zero: Display "N/A" or "Cannot calculate" with explanation
- Insufficient snapshots for TWR/CAGR: Display "Insufficient data (need at least 2 snapshots)"

### Data Integrity

- Category deletion blocked if assets assigned
- Asset deletion blocked if SnapshotAssetValues exist
- Snapshot deletion requires confirmation
- Value edits validated (must be a valid number)
- Cash flow description uniqueness enforced per snapshot

______________________________________________________________________

## Design Principles

All calculations must be:

- **Deterministic** -- same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Recomputable** -- derived values are never the source of truth
- **Transparent** -- user can see what data drives each number
- **Auditable** -- data sources are visible, not hidden

```
Raw Snapshot Data -> Derived Metrics -> Visualization
```

NOT:

```
Spreadsheet Formulas -> UI
```

## App Lock (Authentication)

### Overview

Optional app-level authentication to protect against casual physical access. Uses macOS `LocalAuthentication` framework with `LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthentication`.

### Rules

1. **Off by default** — user enables in Settings → Security
1. **Enable gate** — toggling app lock on triggers a system authentication prompt first; if auth fails, the toggle reverts to off (prevents accidental lockout)
1. **Lock on launch** — if app lock is enabled, the app starts locked and requires authentication
1. **Per-condition re-lock (three-step protocol)** — all lock state is centralized in `AuthenticationService`:
   - **Step 1: `recordBackground(trigger:)`** — called by notification handlers. Two independent triggers:
     - **App switch** (`NSApplication.didResignActiveNotification`) — fires when Cmd+Tab, clicking another window, or minimizing
     - **Screen lock / sleep** — detected via two notifications: `com.apple.screenIsLocked` distributed notification (fires immediately on Ctrl+Cmd+Q and screen lock) and `NSWorkspace.screensDidSleepNotification` (fires on display sleep from lid close or idle timeout). Both are needed because screen lock does not trigger display sleep, and display sleep on external monitors may not trigger screen lock
   - `screenSleep` always overrides a pending `appSwitch` (higher priority). Recording is suppressed while `isAuthenticating` is true to prevent re-lock loops. If the relevant timeout is `.immediately`, `isLocked` is set eagerly (lock overlay appears immediately, auth dialog deferred)
   - **Step 2: `evaluateOnBecomeActive()`** — called on `didBecomeActiveNotification`. Evaluates the pending background event against its timeout and locks if elapsed time exceeds the threshold. Always clears background state afterward
   - **Step 3: `authenticateIfActive()`** — auth dialog is ONLY shown when `isAppActive == true`. This prevents the system authentication dialog from appearing while the user is in another app. `LockScreenView` calls this via `.task(id:)` (for lock-on-launch) and `.onReceive(didBecomeActiveNotification)` (for deferred auth when returning to a locked app)
   - Note: `ScenePhase` is not used because it is unreliable on macOS (only fires for Cmd+H hide)
1. **Window protection** — both the main `WindowGroup` and `Settings` scene use the same `ZStack` + `LockScreenView` overlay pattern. No windows are closed when locking — each window independently shows/hides its own lock overlay based on `authService.isLocked`. This eliminates bugs caused by `NSApplication.shared.mainWindow` returning the wrong window
1. **Menu command gating** — keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N, Cmd+I) are disabled when `authService.isLocked` is true
1. **Re-lock timeouts** — Immediately (0s), After 1 Minute (60s), After 5 Minutes (300s), After 15 Minutes (900s), Never (skip locking for that trigger). Default: Immediately for both triggers
1. **Auto-disable / auto-reset** — when both `appSwitchTimeout` and `screenLockTimeout` are set to `.never`, `isAppLockEnabled` is automatically set to `false` (the user has effectively disabled all lock triggers). Conversely, when re-enabling app lock while both timeouts are still `.never`, both are reset to `.immediately` (the default) so the lock is immediately functional
1. **Authentication method** — not user-configurable. The system dialog handles fallback: Touch ID → Apple Watch → system password
1. **Disabling** — toggling app lock off immediately unlocks the app and disables future locking

### State

- `isAppLockEnabled` — persisted in UserDefaults
- `appSwitchTimeout` — persisted in UserDefaults (raw value of `ReLockTimeout` enum). Timeout for app switch trigger
- `screenLockTimeout` — persisted in UserDefaults (raw value of `ReLockTimeout` enum). Timeout for screen lock / sleep trigger
- `isLocked` — runtime only, not persisted. Set to `true` on launch if app lock is enabled
- `isAppActive` — runtime only, tracks whether the app is the frontmost application. Initialized to `true` (app starts active). Maintained by `didResignActiveNotification` / `didBecomeActiveNotification` handlers in `AssetFlowApp`. Used as a gate for `authenticateIfActive()` to prevent auth dialogs from appearing while the user is in another app
- `backgroundDate` — runtime only, the timestamp when the app entered the background. Set by `recordBackground()`, cleared by `evaluateOnBecomeActive()`
- `backgroundTrigger` — runtime only, which trigger (`.appSwitch` or `.screenSleep`) caused the background event
- `isAuthenticating` — runtime only, `true` while the system authentication dialog is being presented. Used to suppress `recordBackground()` calls
- `lastUnlockDate` — runtime only, set after each successful authentication
