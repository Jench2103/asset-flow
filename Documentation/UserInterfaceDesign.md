# User Interface Design

## Preface

**Purpose of this Document**

This document describes the user interface design for AssetFlow -- **what** users see and **how** they interact with the macOS desktop application. It is separated into two main parts:

1. **Design Specification** -- Visual design, user experience, and interaction patterns
1. **Implementation Guide** -- Technical notes for building the designs in SwiftUI

**Design Philosophy**

- **Iterate in code**: Use Xcode previews instead of separate mockup tools
- **Leverage platform defaults**: Start with native SwiftUI components
- **macOS-native**: Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for macOS
- **Prioritize functionality**: Working features before visual polish

**Related Documentation**

- [BusinessLogic.md](BusinessLogic.md) - Calculations and business rules
- [DataModel.md](DataModel.md) - Data structures
- [Architecture.md](Architecture.md) - MVVM layer responsibilities

**Implementation Status (Current)**

All core screens and features are **implemented**:

- ✅ All 12 Views: Dashboard, Snapshots (list + detail), Assets (list + detail), Categories (list + detail), Platforms, Rebalancing, Import, Settings
- ✅ All 7 chart components with interactive features (hover tooltips, click-to-navigate, time range selectors, empty states)
- ✅ EmptyStateView component for consistent empty state messaging across all views
- ✅ Metric card tooltips (SPEC 3.2) for dashboard metrics
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Delete key for deletion confirmations)

Minor features deferred to future versions:

- Additional keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+I for import, Cmd+N for new snapshot)

______________________________________________________________________

# Part 1: Design Specification

## Navigation Structure

The app uses a **sidebar navigation** layout (standard macOS pattern):

**Sidebar items**:

1. **Dashboard** -- Portfolio overview (default/home screen)
1. **Snapshots** -- Chronological snapshot management
1. **Assets** -- Asset registry and category assignment
1. **Categories** -- Category management with target allocations
1. **Platforms** -- Platform management (rename)
1. **Rebalancing** -- Rebalancing calculator
1. **Import** -- CSV import workflow

**Detail views**: Each sidebar section with a list-detail pattern (Snapshots, Assets, Categories, Platforms) uses a **list-detail split** within the content area. The list appears on the leading side and the detail view on the trailing side. When no item is selected, the detail area shows a placeholder prompt (e.g., "Select a snapshot to view details").

**Dashboard, Rebalancing, and Import** occupy the full content area without a list-detail split.

**Toolbar**:

- Import button (opens the same import flow as the sidebar Import item)

______________________________________________________________________

## Dashboard (Home Screen)

The dashboard provides a portfolio overview using the latest snapshot.

**Layout**:

1. **Summary cards row**:

   - Total Portfolio Value (with change from previous snapshot, absolute and percentage)
   - Latest Snapshot Date
   - Number of Assets
   - Cumulative TWR (All Time) (since first snapshot)
   - CAGR (since first snapshot) -- shown alongside Cumulative TWR (All Time), with a tooltip: "CAGR is the annualized rate at which the portfolio's total value has grown since inception, including the effect of deposits and withdrawals. TWR measures pure investment performance by removing cash flow effects."
   - Metric cards with tooltips use a `tooltipText: String?` parameter on `MetricCard` to display an info icon (`.help()` modifier)

1. **Period performance cards**:

   - **Growth Rate** card -- simple percentage change with 1M / 3M / 1Y segmented control. Shows "N/A" if insufficient history.
   - **Return Rate** card -- Modified Dietz return with 1M / 3M / 1Y segmented control. Shows "N/A" if insufficient history.
   - Each card uses the same `tooltipText` parameter on `MetricCard` for its tooltip

1. **Allocation pie chart**:

   - Category allocation with a **snapshot date picker** (defaults to latest snapshot)
   - Shows percentage and value for each category
   - Clicking a category navigates to category detail

1. **Portfolio value line chart**:

   - Total portfolio value over all snapshots
   - Time axis with snapshot dates
   - Time range zoom controls

1. **Cumulative TWR line chart**:

   - Portfolio-level cumulative time-weighted return over time
   - Shows "Insufficient data (need at least 2 snapshots)" when fewer than 2 snapshots

1. **Recent snapshots list**:

   - Last 5 snapshots (newest first) with date, total value, and import summary
   - "View all" link navigates to Snapshots screen
   - Each row is clickable and navigates to snapshot detail

**Implementation notes (Charts)**:

- **DashboardView** (`AssetFlow/Views/DashboardView.swift`): Replaced chart placeholders with 2x2 grid of interactive charts. Row 1: `CategoryAllocationPieChart` (with snapshot date picker, click-to-navigate to category) + `PortfolioValueLineChart` (with click-to-navigate to snapshot). Row 2: `CumulativeTWRLineChart` + `CategoryValueLineChart` (multi-line with legend toggle). Each line chart has an independent `ChartTimeRange` `@State` that defaults to `.all` and resets on navigation via `dashboardRefreshID`.
- **`CategoryAllocationPieChart`**: HStack layout with pie chart (flexible width) and legend panel (150pt fixed width).
- **DashboardViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift`): Added `snapshotDates`, `categoryValueHistory` (per-category `[DashboardDataPoint]`), and `categoryAllocations(forSnapshotDate:)` for historical pie chart data. Extracted `computeCategoryAllocationsForSnapshot` helper for reuse.
- **ChartDataService** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/ChartDataService.swift`): Stateless `enum` with `ChartTimeRange` (8 cases: 1W/1M/3M/6M/1Y/3Y/5Y/All), `filter()` overloads for `DashboardDataPoint`/`CategoryValueHistoryEntry`/`CategoryAllocationHistoryEntry`, and `abbreviatedLabel(for:)` for K/M/B Y-axis formatting. Filtering uses latest data point's date as reference (not `Date.now`).
- **Shared chart components** in `AssetFlow/Views/Charts/`: `ChartTimeRangeSelector` (segmented picker), `ChartStyles` (constants and color palette), and 5 chart views. All charts handle empty/edge states per SPEC 12.5.
- **ContentView** (`AssetFlow/Views/ContentView.swift`): Added `navigateToCategoryByName(_:)` to wire pie chart click → sidebar Categories selection. Guards against "Uncategorized" (not a real Category).

______________________________________________________________________

## Snapshots Screen

**List view**:

- Chronological list of all snapshots (newest first), grouped into collapsible relative time buckets
- Time buckets: **This Month**, **Previous 3 Months**, **Previous 6 Months**, **Previous Year**, **Older** — boundaries based on calendar month starts relative to today; empty buckets are hidden
- Collapsible `Section(isExpanded:)` disclosure triangles; all sections expanded by default
- Each row: date, total value, platforms included, number of assets
- "New Snapshot" button

**New Snapshot creation flow**:

1. User clicks "New Snapshot"
1. Date picker appears (future dates disabled)
1. If the selected date already has a snapshot, show validation error: "A snapshot already exists for [date]. Go to the Snapshots screen to view and edit it."
1. Starting point selector:
   - **Start empty**: Creates snapshot with no asset entries
   - **Copy from latest**: Pre-populates with all direct SnapshotAssetValues from the most recent prior snapshot. Disabled (grayed out with explanatory text) when no snapshots exist before the selected date.
1. On creation, user is taken to the snapshot detail view for editing

**Snapshot detail view** (on selection):

- Full asset breakdown table sorted by platform (alphabetical), then by asset name (alphabetical)
- Columns: Asset Name, Platform, Category, Market Value
- Category allocation summary for this snapshot
- Cash flow operations table: Description, Amount
- Net cash flow summary line
- Actions: Add asset, Edit values, Remove asset, Delete snapshot, Add cash flow, Edit cash flow, Remove cash flow

**Add asset to snapshot**: Two paths:

1. **Select existing asset**: Autocomplete search by name. When selected, platform and category are read-only (inherited from asset record). Rejected if the asset already exists in this snapshot.
1. **Create new asset**: Enter name, select platform (picker includes a "New Platform..." option), select category (picker includes a "New Category..." option). Creates the asset record and adds it to the snapshot.

**Edit value**: Right-click an asset row and select "Edit Value" to open an inline popover anchored to the row. The popover contains a single text field and Save/Cancel buttons. Changes are saved immediately on Save.

**Remove asset from snapshot**: Confirmation dialog: "Remove [Asset Name] from this snapshot? The asset record itself will not be deleted."

**Delete snapshot**: Confirmation dialog: "Delete snapshot from [date]? This will remove all [N] asset values and [M] cash flow operations. This action cannot be undone."

______________________________________________________________________

## Assets Screen

**List view**:

- All known assets, grouped by platform (default) or category, switchable via **segmented control**
- Sort order: alphabetical by asset name within each group
- When grouped by platform, assets without a platform appear under "(No Platform)" at the end
- When grouped by category, assets without a category appear under "(Uncategorized)" at the end
- Each row: Asset Name, Platform, Category, Latest Value
- Latest value comes from the most recent snapshot
- Assets with no snapshot values show "\\u{2014}" for value

**Asset detail view**:

- Value history across snapshots (table and sparkline -- a compact inline line chart for quick trend recognition, non-interactive)
- Value history shows all recorded values across snapshots
- Asset name (editable)
- Platform (editable via picker with existing platforms + "New Platform..." option)
- Category assignment (editable via picker with existing categories + "None" option)
- Changes save immediately on field change
- Renaming an asset updates it retroactively across all snapshots (single record update)
- Duplicate identity validation: (name, platform) must be unique (case-insensitive, trimmed, collapsed)
- Delete action: **only enabled when asset has no SnapshotAssetValue records**. When disabled, shows: "This asset cannot be deleted because it has values in snapshot(s). Remove the asset from all snapshots first."

### Implementation Notes

- **AssetListView** (`AssetFlow/Views/AssetListView.swift`): Uses `AssetListViewModel` with `@State`. Segmented control binds to `viewModel.groupingMode`. List sections iterate over `viewModel.groups`. Context menu on rows provides delete action for eligible assets.
- **AssetDetailView** (`AssetFlow/Views/AssetDetailView.swift`): Uses `AssetDetailViewModel` with `@State`. Form with `.grouped` style. Platform picker uses `Binding<String>` with sentinel `"__new__"` for inline new-platform creation. Sparkline uses Swift Charts `LineMark` with hidden axes, 40pt height. Delete confirmation dialog before deletion.
- **AssetListViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/AssetListViewModel.swift`): Groups assets by platform or category. Computes latest values from the most recent snapshot. "(No Platform)" and "(Uncategorized)" groups always sorted last.
- **AssetDetailViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/AssetDetailViewModel.swift`): Editable fields (`editedName`, `editedPlatform`, `editedCategory`) initialized from asset. `save()` validates normalized identity uniqueness. `loadValueHistory()` returns direct SAVs sorted chronologically.

______________________________________________________________________

## Categories Screen

**List view**:

- All categories listed alphabetically
- Each row: name, target allocation %, current allocation %, current value, asset count
- Visual indicator when current allocation deviates significantly from target
- Add/edit/delete category actions

**Category detail view**:

- Assets in this category
- Value history over snapshots (line chart)
- Allocation percentage history over snapshots (line chart)

**Cross-section navigation**: Clicking a category in the dashboard pie chart navigates to the Categories section in the sidebar and selects the clicked category, showing its detail view. This is a cross-section navigation action (Dashboard -> Categories).

**Implementation notes:**

- **CategoryListView** (`AssetFlow/Views/CategoryListView.swift`): Takes `modelContext` and `selectedCategory: Binding<Category?>`. Uses `@State private var viewModel: CategoryListViewModel`. List selection drives the binding. Toolbar "+" button opens add category sheet. Target allocation sum warning banner shown at top when allocations don't sum to 100%. Deviation indicator (orange `exclamationmark.triangle.fill`) shown when `abs(current - target) > 5`. Empty state uses folder icon.
- **CategoryListViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/CategoryListViewModel.swift`): `CategoryRowData` struct bundles category, target/current allocation, value, and asset count. `loadCategories()` batch-fetches all data and computes values from the latest snapshot. `createCategory`/`editCategory`/`deleteCategory` with validation via `CategoryError`.
- **CategoryDetailView** (`AssetFlow/Views/CategoryDetailView.swift`): Takes `category`, `modelContext`, `onDelete`. Parent must apply `.id(category.id)` for proper state reset. Form sections: Category Details (name + target allocation), Assets in Category (Table), Value History (LineMark + PointMark chart), Allocation History (LineMark + PointMark chart), Danger Zone (delete button).
- **CategoryDetailViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/CategoryDetailViewModel.swift`): `editedName`/`editedTargetAllocation` initialized from category. `loadData()` computes asset list with latest values, value history, and allocation history across all snapshots. Single snapshot renders as PointMark only.

**Implementation notes (Charts):**

- Value history chart now uses `ChartTimeRangeSelector` with `ChartDataService.filter()` for time range zoom. Y-axis uses abbreviated labels (K/M/B).
- Allocation history chart replaced with reusable `CategoryAllocationLineChart` component from `Views/Charts/`, which includes time range selector and hover tooltips.
- Both chart time ranges default to `.all` and reset when the selected category changes (via `.id(category.id)` on the parent).

______________________________________________________________________

## Platforms Screen

**List view**:

- All platforms listed alphabetically
- Each row: Platform name, number of assets, total latest value

**Platform detail view** (on selection):

- List of all assets on this platform with their latest market values
- Total value across all assets on this platform
- Platform name (editable)

**Actions**:

- **Rename**: Change platform name. Updates all assets. New name must not conflict (case-insensitive).
- **Delete**: Implicit -- when all assets are moved away, platform no longer appears.

Assets with no platform are NOT shown on the Platforms screen.

### Implementation Notes

**Layout**: 3-column split (sidebar | platform list | platform detail), consistent with Snapshots, Assets, and Categories. `ContentView` uses an `HStack(spacing: 0)` with `PlatformListView`, a `Divider`, and `PlatformDetailView` (or a "Select a platform" placeholder when nothing is selected). `PlatformDetailView` uses `.id(platform)` for forced recreation on rename.

**Rename-propagation flow**:

1. User edits name in `PlatformDetailView` → hits Return
1. `PlatformDetailViewModel.save()` validates and renames all matching `Asset.platform` values
1. `save()` updates internal `platformName` state
1. Detail view calls `onRename(newName)` callback
1. `ContentView` sets `selectedPlatform = newName` (triggers `.id()` recreation of detail view)
1. `PlatformListView.onChange(of: selectedPlatform)` fires → `viewModel.loadPlatforms()` refreshes list

**Platforms are not SwiftData model objects** — they are derived from distinct non-empty `Asset.platform` string values. Selection binding is `String?` (not a model ID), and rename mutates all `Asset` records with the old platform name.

- **PlatformListView** (`AssetFlow/Views/PlatformListView.swift`): List-detail split with `List(selection: $selectedPlatform)`. Row context menu retains rename popover for quick renaming. `.onChange(of: selectedPlatform)` reloads platforms after rename propagation. Empty state with `building.columns` icon.
- **PlatformDetailView** (`AssetFlow/Views/PlatformDetailView.swift`): `Form(.grouped)` with three sections: Platform Details (editable name `TextField`), Assets on Platform (`Table` with Name, Category, Value columns), and Value History (line chart with `ChartTimeRangeSelector` and hover tooltip). No delete section — platforms disappear when all assets are reassigned.
- **PlatformListViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/PlatformListViewModel.swift`): Derives platforms from `Asset.platform` values. `loadPlatforms()` computes totals from the latest snapshot. `renamePlatform(from:to:)` validates uniqueness (case-insensitive), trims and normalizes whitespace, then updates all matching assets.
- **PlatformDetailViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/PlatformDetailViewModel.swift`): Tracks `platformName` (updated after rename), `assets` (filtered to this platform, sorted alphabetically), `totalValue` (sum of latest values), and `valueHistory` (platform total per snapshot). `save()` validates and renames all matching Asset records.

______________________________________________________________________

## Rebalancing Screen

- Current allocation vs. target allocation table
- For each category: current value, current %, target %, difference ($), action (buy/sell amount)
- Sort order: by absolute adjustment magnitude (largest deviation first)
- Summary of suggested moves
- Read-only/preview -- no data modification occurs
- Only categories with a target allocation are included
- Uncategorized assets shown as separate row with "--" for Target % and "N/A" for Action

### Implementation Notes

- **RebalancingView** (`AssetFlow/Views/RebalancingView.swift`): ScrollView with Grid-based tables. Three sections: "Categories with Targets" (main suggestions), "No Target Set", and "Uncategorized". Summary section shows suggested moves. Action text color-coded: green (Buy), red (Sell), gray (No action needed). Empty state with `chart.bar.doc.horizontal` icon.
- **RebalancingViewModel** (`AssetFlow/ViewModels/RebalancingViewModel.swift`): Loads values from latest snapshot. Groups by category, calls `RebalancingCalculator.calculateAdjustments()`, maps actions to display rows with localized action text. Adjustments under $1 display "No action needed" (SPEC 11.4).

______________________________________________________________________

## Import Screen

See [BusinessLogic.md](BusinessLogic.md) for the detailed CSV import flow.

**Layout**:

- **Import type selector**: Segmented control (Assets | Cash Flows), defaults to Assets
- **File selector**: Drag-and-drop zone or "Browse" button (filtered to `.csv`)
- **Expected schema display**: Show the expected CSV column names for the selected import type and provide downloadable sample CSVs
- **Configuration** (after file selected):
  - Asset import: Snapshot date picker (future dates disabled), Platform picker, Category picker
  - Cash flow import: Snapshot date picker (future dates disabled)
- **Preview table**: Parsed data with validation indicators and per-row remove buttons
  - If an asset already exists with a different category than the import-level category, a warning indicator is shown on that row
- **Validation summary**: Errors (red) and warnings (yellow)
- **Import button**: Disabled if validation errors exist
- **On successful import**: Snapshot is created (or updated if one exists for that date); user is navigated to the snapshot detail view

If user navigates away (including sidebar navigation) with file loaded but not imported, confirmation dialog: "Discard import? The selected file has not been imported yet."

______________________________________________________________________

## Empty States

All empty states use the reusable `EmptyStateView` component (`AssetFlow/Views/Components/EmptyStateView.swift`), which provides a consistent layout: centered SF Symbol icon (size 48, secondary), title (title2), descriptive message (callout, secondary, multiline center), and optional action buttons (primary uses `.borderedProminent`).

| Screen      | Icon                       | Title                | Message                                                                                          | Actions                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |

| Rebalancing | `chart.bar.doc.horizontal` | No Rebalancing Data  | Set target allocations on your categories to use the rebalancing calculator.                     | —                               |

______________________________________________________________________

## Settings

Accessible via menu bar (AssetFlow > Settings) or Cmd+,.

**Settings options**:

1. **Display currency**: Currency code (e.g., USD, TWD, EUR). Display-only, no FX conversion.
1. **Date format**: Picker with Swift `Date.FormatStyle` options (`.numeric`, `.abbreviated`, `.long`, `.complete`). Default: system locale or `.abbreviated`.
1. **Default platform**: Pre-filled platform value during import (can be overridden per import). Default: empty.
1. **Data Management**:
   - **Export Backup**: Exports all data to ZIP archive. User selects save location. Default filename: `AssetFlow-Backup-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`.
   - **Restore from Backup**: Imports backup archive. Confirmation: "Restoring from backup will replace ALL existing data. This cannot be undone. Continue?" Validates file integrity (CSV presence, headers, foreign key references). On failure, shows detailed error. On success, reloads all views.
1. **About**: App identity and legal information at the bottom of Settings.
   - **App identity row**: App icon (48×48), app name (headline), version + build number (subheadline), commit hash (caption). The commit hash includes a `-dev` suffix when built from a dirty working tree.
   - **Developer**: Static field showing the developer name.
   - **License**: Static field showing the license (Apache License 2.0).
   - **Privacy**: "All data is stored locally. No data is collected or transmitted."
   - **GitHub link**: Tappable `Link` that opens the source repository in the browser.

**Native About panel** (App menu → About AssetFlow): Replaced via `CommandGroup(replacing: .appInfo)` in `AssetFlowApp.swift`. Shows version + build number as the version string, with a rich-text credits block containing the commit hash, license, copyright, a clickable "Source Code" hyperlink, and the privacy statement.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Context                       | Action                                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delete   | Snapshot list (item selected) | Delete selected snapshot (confirmation dialog)                   |
| Delete   | Asset list (item selected)    | Delete selected asset (error alert if it has snapshot values)    |
| Delete   | Category list (item selected) | Delete selected category (error alert if it has assigned assets) |
| Cmd+,    | Global                        | Open Settings window (standard macOS `Settings` scene)           |

**Implementation**: Delete key uses `.onDeleteCommand` on each List view, delegating to the same ViewModel delete methods as the context menu. The Settings shortcut is provided automatically by the SwiftUI `Settings` scene in `AssetFlowApp.swift`.

Additional shortcuts (Cmd+I, Cmd+N, etc.) deferred to future version.

______________________________________________________________________

## Localization

AssetFlow uses Apple String Catalogs (`.xcstrings`) with **English** as the development language and **Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant)** as the additional supported language.

**String catalog organization by feature:**

| Catalog                 | Scope                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Localizable.xcstrings` | All SwiftUI view-level strings (auto-extracted) |
| `Asset.xcstrings`       | Asset validation and error messages             |
| `Category.xcstrings`    | Category validation and error messages          |
| `Platform.xcstrings`    | Platform operation messages                     |
| `Snapshot.xcstrings`    | Snapshot validation and error messages          |
| `Import.xcstrings`      | Import workflow messages                        |
| `Rebalancing.xcstrings` | Rebalancing action text                         |
| `Services.xcstrings`    | Backup/restore messages                         |
| `Settings.xcstrings`    | Settings display strings                        |

**Conventions:**

- SwiftUI view strings (in `Text()`, `Label()`, etc.) are auto-extracted into `Localizable.xcstrings`
- ViewModel and Service strings use `String(localized:table:)` with the appropriate feature table
- Enum display names use `localizedName` computed properties — never display `rawValue` directly
- Translation style: idiomatic Traditional Chinese matching Taiwan usage (e.g., 資產, 快照, 類別, 平台, 再平衡, 儀表板, 匯入, 備份)

______________________________________________________________________

## Window and Appearance

- **Window style**: `.windowStyle(.hiddenTitleBar)` with `.windowToolbarStyle(.unified)` for modern macOS Tahoe Liquid Glass integration
- **Minimum window size**: 900 x 600 points
- **Sidebar**: Collapsible via toolbar button or drag. Default width: 220 points.
- **Appearance**: Supports system appearance (light and dark mode). All custom colors and chart colors adapt to both modes.

**Number formatting**:

- Monetary values: Full stored precision with thousand separators (e.g., $1,234.5, $28,000). No minimum or maximum decimal places are enforced -- values display exactly as entered or computed.
- Percentages: 2 decimal places (e.g., 45.23%)
- Chart axes: Abbreviated for large values (K, M, B)

Allocation percentage totals display actual sum (no forced normalization to 100%).

______________________________________________________________________

## Visualizations

### Time Range Controls

All line charts include a zoom selector:

- 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 3Y, 5Y, All
- Default: All
- Shows only snapshots within selected range
- "No data for selected period" if empty
- Range resets to "All" when navigating away (not persisted)

### Pie Chart -- Category Allocation (Section 12.1)

- Shows allocation at a selected snapshot (default: latest)
- Each slice = one category
- Slices sorted by value (largest first, clockwise from 12 o'clock)
- Uncategorized shown as distinct slice (uses a neutral/gray tone to indicate it is not a user-defined category)
- Labels: category name, percentage, value
- Legend is displayed as a fixed-width (150pt) vertical panel to the right of the pie chart, showing color swatch, category name, and percentage for each category. Legend items are interactive: hovering highlights the corresponding slice, and clicking navigates to category detail.
- Hover: tooltip with details. Click: navigates to category detail.

### Line Chart -- Portfolio Value Over Time (Section 12.2)

- X-axis: snapshot dates. Y-axis: portfolio total value.
- Data points at each snapshot
- Hover: tooltip with date and value. Click: navigates to snapshot detail.
- Time range zoom controls

### Line Chart -- Category Value Over Time (Section 12.3)

- Multiple lines, one per category
- Legend with category names
- Toggle individual categories on/off
- Hover: tooltip with date, category name, value. No click-to-navigate.
- Time range zoom controls

Category detail also includes allocation percentage line chart (same format, single category).

### Cumulative TWR Chart (Section 12.4)

- X-axis: snapshot dates. Y-axis: cumulative TWR (%)
- Portfolio-level return over time
- Hover: tooltip with date and TWR percentage. No click-to-navigate.
- Time range zoom controls
- **Rebasing:** When a non-"All" time range is selected, TWR values are rebased so the first visible point starts at 0%, showing period-specific returns. The "All" range shows inception-based values unchanged.
- The metric card is labeled "Cumulative TWR (All Time)" to distinguish it from the chart's period-rebased values.

### Chart Empty and Edge States

| Chart                  | Condition                                | Display                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Pie chart              | All assets uncategorized                 | Single slice "Uncategorized" 100%               |
| Pie chart              | No assets in latest snapshot             | "No asset data available"                       |
| Line chart (portfolio) | Only one snapshot                        | Single data point with label, no line           |
| Line chart (portfolio) | No snapshots in range                    | "No data for selected period"                   |
| Line chart (category)  | No categories defined                    | "Create categories to see allocation trends"    |
| Line chart (category)  | Category has zero value in all snapshots | Omit from chart, show "(no data)" in legend     |
| TWR chart              | Fewer than 2 snapshots                   | "Insufficient data (need at least 2 snapshots)" |
| TWR chart              | All returns N/A in range                 | "Cannot calculate returns for selected period"  |

## Visual Style

### Color Usage

**Semantic Colors** (leverage system defaults):

- **Accent**: Primary actions and highlights (system blue)
- **Positive**: Value increases (green)
- **Negative**: Value decreases (red)
- **Neutral**: Informational (gray)

**Automatic Dark Mode**: Use semantic color names, test all screens in both modes.

### Typography

- **Screen Titles**: `.title` or `.largeTitle`
- **Section Headers**: `.title2` or `.title3`
- **Primary Content**: `.body`
- **Secondary Info**: `.subheadline` or `.caption`
- **Financial Values**: Monospaced digits for alignment

**Formatting**:

- Currency: Use `Decimal` with `.formatted(currency:)` extension
- Percentages: Use `.formattedPercentage()` extension
- Large numbers: K, M, B suffixes in chart axes

### Iconography

**SF Symbols**:

- Add: `plus.circle.fill`
- Edit: `pencil`
- Delete: `trash`
- Import: `square.and.arrow.down`
- Export: `square.and.arrow.up`
- Info: `info.circle`
- Chart: `chart.pie.fill`, `chart.xyaxis.line`

### Spacing and Layout

- 8pt base unit (small: 8pt, medium: 16pt, large: 24pt)
- Cards: Secondary background, 16pt padding, 10-12pt corner radius
- Lists: Full width within safe areas

### Component Patterns

- **Empty States**: Centered icon, brief message, call-to-action button
- **Loading States**: Progress spinner with text
- **Error States**: Error icon, clear message, suggested action
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: For all destructive actions (delete snapshot, delete asset from snapshot, restore from backup)

## Accessibility Considerations

### Visual Accessibility

- Use semantic colors (WCAG AA contrast)
- Support Dynamic Type
- Provide non-animated alternatives (Reduce Motion)

### Screen Reader (VoiceOver)

- All interactive elements have clear labels
- Logical reading order
- Actionable items clearly identified

### Keyboard Navigation

- Full keyboard navigation on macOS
- Logical tab order
- Visible focus indicators

# Part 2: Implementation Guide

## SwiftUI Implementation Patterns

### Navigation Structure

```swift
NavigationSplitView {
    // Sidebar
    List(selection: $selectedSection) {
        NavigationLink(value: Section.dashboard) {
            Label("Dashboard", systemImage: "chart.bar")
        }
        NavigationLink(value: Section.snapshots) {
            Label("Snapshots", systemImage: "calendar")
        }
        // ... other items
    }
    .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min: 180, ideal: 220)
} detail: {
    switch selectedSection {
    case .dashboard:
        DashboardView()
    case .snapshots:
        SnapshotsSplitView()
    // ... other sections
    }
}
.frame(minWidth: 900, minHeight: 600)
```

### List-Detail Split Pattern

For sections with list-detail (Snapshots, Assets, Categories, Platforms), the outer `NavigationSplitView` provides the sidebar+detail layout, and each inner split view provides the list+detail layout within the detail column. This creates a 3-column layout on macOS (sidebar | list | detail). Use `NavigationSplitView(columnVisibility:)` with `.all` to ensure the 3-column mode is available:

```swift
struct SnapshotsSplitView: View {
    @Query(sort: \Snapshot.date, order: .reverse)
    private var snapshots: [Snapshot]
    @State private var selectedSnapshot: Snapshot?

    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView {
            List(snapshots, selection: $selectedSnapshot) { snapshot in
                SnapshotRowView(snapshot: snapshot)
            }
            .toolbar {
                Button("New Snapshot", systemImage: "plus") { /* ... */ }
            }
        } detail: {
            if let snapshot = selectedSnapshot {
                SnapshotDetailView(snapshot: snapshot)
            } else {
                ContentUnavailableView(
                    "Select a Snapshot",
                    systemImage: "calendar",
                    description: Text("Select a snapshot to view details")
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Popover Pattern for Quick Edits

Lightweight edit interactions (1-2 fields) use `.popover()` anchored to their trigger row instead of modal sheets. This provides faster, less disruptive editing:

```swift
.popover(
    isPresented: Binding(
        get: { editingItem?.id == item.id },
        set: { if !$0 { editingItem = nil } }
    ),
    arrowEdge: .trailing
) {
    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {
        Text("Edit Value").font(.headline)
        TextField("Value", text: $valueText).textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        HStack {
            Button("Cancel") { dismiss() }.keyboardShortcut(.cancelAction)
            Spacer()
            Button("Save") { save() }.keyboardShortcut(.defaultAction)
        }
    }
    .frame(width: 280)
    .padding()
}
```

Popovers are used for: Edit Asset Value, Edit Cash Flow, Rename Platform. Complex multi-field forms (Add Asset, Add Cash Flow, Add Category) remain as modal sheets.

### Chart Implementation

Use Swift Charts framework:

```swift
import Charts

// Pie chart for category allocation
Chart(categoryData) { item in
    SectorMark(
        angle: .value("Value", item.value),
        innerRadius: .ratio(0.5)
    )
    .foregroundStyle(by: .value("Category", item.name))
}

// Line chart for portfolio value
Chart(snapshotData) { point in
    LineMark(
        x: .value("Date", point.date),
        y: .value("Value", point.totalValue)
    )
    PointMark(
        x: .value("Date", point.date),
        y: .value("Value", point.totalValue)
    )
}
```

### Import Screen Implementation

```swift
struct ImportView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = ImportViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Import type selector
            Picker("Import Type", selection: $viewModel.importType) {
                Text("Assets").tag(ImportType.assets)
                Text("Cash Flows").tag(ImportType.cashFlows)
            }
            .pickerStyle(.segmented)

            // File drop zone
            FileDropZone(url: $viewModel.selectedFile)

            // Configuration (date, platform, category)
            if viewModel.selectedFile != nil {
                ImportConfigurationView(viewModel: viewModel)
                ImportPreviewTable(viewModel: viewModel)
                ImportValidationSummary(viewModel: viewModel)
            }

            // Import button
            Button("Import") { viewModel.executeImport() }
                .disabled(viewModel.isImportDisabled)
        }
    }
}
```

### Reusable Components

**CurrencyText**: Use `Decimal.formatted(currency:)` extension

```swift
Text(value.formatted(currency: settings.displayCurrency))
    .font(.title2)
    .fontWeight(.semibold)
```

**PercentageText**: Color-coded percentage display

```swift
Text(percentage.formattedPercentage())
    .foregroundColor(percentage >= 0 ? .green : .red)
```

**MetricCard**: Card container for dashboard metrics

```swift
VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
    HStack {
        Text("Total Portfolio Value")
            .font(.subheadline)
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        Button(action: { showTooltip.toggle() }) {
            Image(systemName: "info.circle")
        }
    }
    Text(value.formatted(currency: "USD"))
        .font(.title)
        .fontWeight(.bold)
}
.padding()
.background(.regularMaterial)
.cornerRadius(10)
```

## Development Workflow

### Before Building a Screen

1. Define the screen's purpose in one sentence
1. Identify which models/queries are needed
1. Choose container (List, Form, ScrollView, or custom layout)
1. Plan navigation (how users arrive and leave)

### While Building

1. Use Xcode Previews for rapid iteration
1. Test with realistic data and edge cases
1. Check light and dark mode
1. Verify Dynamic Type scaling

### After Implementation

1. Add empty states
1. Add loading states (if async)
1. Add error handling UI
1. Verify keyboard navigation
1. Test VoiceOver (basic navigation)
