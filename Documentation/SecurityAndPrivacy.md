# Security and Privacy

## Preface

**Purpose of this Document**

This document outlines the security and privacy considerations for AssetFlow, a personal finance application handling sensitive financial data. It describes the measures taken to protect user data, ensure privacy, and maintain secure operation on macOS.

**Philosophy**

1. **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection, user owns all data
1. **Local-First**: Data stays on user's device -- network used only for exchange rate fetching (no authentication, no user data sent)
1. **Platform Trust**: Leverage Apple's security infrastructure
1. **Transparency**: Clear communication about data handling
1. **User Control**: Users can export, delete, or back up their data

## Threat Model

### Assets to Protect

**Sensitive Data**:

- Portfolio composition and asset values
- Snapshot history (reveals wealth trajectory over time)
- Category allocations and target allocations
- Cash flow operations (deposits, withdrawals)
- Backup files (contain all of the above)

**Sensitivity Level**: **High**

- Exposure could reveal user's wealth, investment strategy, and financial situation
- Not authentication credentials, but valuable for profiling

### Potential Threats

**Local Device Threats**:

1. **Physical Device Access**: Unauthorized person accesses unlocked Mac
1. **Device Theft**: Lost or stolen Mac
1. **Malware**: Malicious software on the device
1. **Backup Exposure**: Unencrypted backup files accessible to others

**Backup File Threats**:

5. **Unsecured Export Files**: ZIP backup files stored in unprotected locations
1. **Shared Storage**: Backup files on shared drives, cloud storage, or email

### Mitigations

**Device-Level Security** (Apple Platform Features):

1. **File System Encryption**: FileVault encrypts the entire disk
1. **App Sandbox**: macOS sandbox isolates app data from other apps
1. **Code Signing**: App signed by developer, ensures integrity
1. **Hardened Runtime**: Prevents code injection and memory tampering
1. **Gatekeeper**: macOS verifies signed apps before launch

**Application-Level Security**:

1. **Minimal Network Access**: Only exchange rate fetching from a public CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`). No user data is sent in requests — only the base currency code and date. No authentication or API keys required.
1. **No API Keys**: No secrets to manage or leak
1. **SwiftData Encryption**: Leverages platform database encryption (FileVault)
1. **No Logging of Sensitive Data**: Financial values never logged to console
1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before processing
1. **Secure Deletion**: SwiftData removes data when user requests

## Data Security

### Data Storage

**SwiftData Persistence**:

- **Location**: App sandbox directory (isolated from other apps)
- **Encryption**: Encrypted at rest when FileVault is enabled (recommended)

**No Network Storage**:

- No cloud sync, no iCloud, no remote servers
- All data resides exclusively on the user's Mac

### Backup File Security

**Export Format**: ZIP archive containing CSV files and a manifest.json.

**Implementation**: Uses macOS built-in `/usr/bin/ditto` command for ZIP creation and extraction. No external dependencies or third-party libraries.

**Security Characteristics**:

- Backup files are **not encrypted** by the application
- They contain all financial data in human-readable CSV format
- User is responsible for storing backup files securely

**Recommendations to Users**:

- Store backup files in an encrypted volume or directory
- Do not share backup files via unencrypted channels (email, public cloud)
- Delete old backup files when no longer needed
- Consider encrypting backup files with a third-party tool if storing on shared media

**Restore Security**:

- Restore operation validates file integrity before modifying data
- Validation includes CSV structure, column headers, and foreign key references
- If validation fails, no data is modified
- Restore requires explicit confirmation: "Restoring from backup will replace ALL existing data. This cannot be undone."

### App Lock (Optional)

**Purpose**: Protects against casual physical access to portfolio data when the Mac is unlocked but unattended.

**Implementation**: Uses macOS `LocalAuthentication` framework (`LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthentication`):

- Touch ID on supported Macs (Apple silicon with compatible keyboard)
- Apple Watch proximity unlock
- System password fallback (always available)

**Threat Addressed**: Unauthorized viewing of financial data by someone with physical access to an unlocked Mac. This is a convenience feature, not a security boundary — it does not protect against determined attackers with admin access.

**Security Characteristics**:

- Off by default — user enables in Settings → Security
- No secrets or credentials stored by the app
- Biometric evaluation happens entirely in the Secure Enclave — no biometric data leaves the device
- Lock screen uses an opaque material overlay (both main window and Settings window have independent `LockScreenView` overlays)
- Centralized lock state machine in `AuthenticationService`: three-step protocol (`recordBackground` → `evaluateOnBecomeActive` → `authenticateIfActive`) with `isAppActive` gate ensures auth dialogs only appear when the app is frontmost
- Per-condition re-lock timeouts: separate settings for app switching and screen lock/sleep events, each configurable to immediately, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or never. Setting both to "never" auto-disables app lock
- Eager lock, deferred auth: lock overlay appears immediately when timeout is "Immediately"; authentication dialog waits until the user returns to the app
- Enabling app lock requires successful authentication first (prevents accidental lockout)
- Menu commands (Cmd+N, Cmd+I) are disabled while locked to prevent keyboard shortcut bypass
- Toolbar buttons (navigation back/forward, add snapshot/category, grouping picker) are disabled while locked
- All `.help()` tooltips are suppressed while locked via the `.helpWhenUnlocked()` view modifier and `isAppLocked` environment key, preventing tooltip leakage through the lock overlay

**Limitations**:

- Does not encrypt data at rest (use FileVault for that)
- Does not prevent access via other apps that can read the SwiftData store
- Not all Macs have Touch ID — system password is the universal fallback

## Privacy

### Data Collection

**What Data is Collected**: None by the developer.

- All data is user-entered and stored locally
- No analytics, telemetry, or usage tracking
- No crash reporting sent to the developer

**What Data is NOT Collected**:

- No personal identifiers (name, email, phone)
- No usage patterns or behavior data
- No location data
- Network requests are limited to fetching exchange rates from a public CDN — only the base currency code and date are included in the URL; no user data, financial values, or portfolio information is ever transmitted

**Data Ownership**:

- User owns 100% of their data
- Data stored only on user's device
- No server-side storage by developer

### Data Usage

**Within the App**:

- Data used solely for app functionality (calculations, displays, charts)
- No secondary use (no ads, no profiling, no recommendations)

**With Third Parties**:

- **No user data shared with third parties** -- exchange rate requests contain only a currency code and date, no personal or financial data
- No data sold or shared with any entity

### User Control

**Data Export**:

- User can export all data via the backup feature (ZIP archive)
- Enables backup and migration to other tools

**Data Deletion**:

- User can delete individual snapshots, assets, categories, and cash flow operations
- Uninstalling app removes all local data (app sandbox is deleted)

## Platform Security Features

### macOS Security

**App Sandbox**:

- Enabled (App Store requirement)
- Restricts file system access to app's container
- `com.apple.security.network.client` entitlement required for exchange rate fetching

**Hardened Runtime**:

- Enabled for distribution
- Prevents code injection, memory tampering
- Required for notarization

**Code Signing**:

- App signed with Developer ID
- Ensures integrity and verifies developer

**Gatekeeper**:

- macOS checks signed apps before launch
- Prevents running tampered or malicious apps

**FileVault**:

- Encrypts entire disk when enabled by user
- All SwiftData files encrypted at rest
- Strongly recommended for users storing financial data

## Secure Coding Practices

### Input Validation

**Financial Inputs**:

- Validate all user inputs (market values, amounts, dates)
- Use `Decimal` type (prevents floating-point injection risks)
- Reject invalid formats during CSV parsing
- Enforce uniqueness constraints (asset identity, snapshot dates, cash flow descriptions)

**CSV Import Validation**:

- Validate file encoding (UTF-8)
- Validate required columns exist
- Validate number formatting per row
- Detect duplicates within CSV and against existing data
- Block entire import if validation errors exist (no partial imports)

### No Sensitive Data Logging

**Prohibition**: Never log financial values, asset names, or portfolio data to console.

**SwiftLint Rule**: `print()` statements are prohibited.

```swift
// BAD
print("Portfolio value: \(totalValue)")

// GOOD
logger.info("Portfolio value calculated successfully")
```

### Secure Deletion

**Data Deletion**:

- When user deletes a snapshot, SwiftData removes all associated SnapshotAssetValues and CashFlowOperations (cascade)
- When user deletes an asset (if allowed), SwiftData removes all associated SnapshotAssetValues (cascade)
- OS handles secure file deletion at the SQLite level

**App Uninstall**:

- Uninstalling app removes app sandbox (all data deleted)
- Backup files stored outside the sandbox persist (user must delete manually)

## Conclusion

AssetFlow's **local-first, privacy-by-design architecture** inherently mitigates many security and privacy risks. With minimal network access (only exchange rate fetching from a public CDN), no data collection, and no user data transmission, the primary security concerns are limited to local device protection and backup file security.

**Key Principles**:

- All data stays on the user's device
- Network access limited to exchange rate fetching (no user data sent)
- No third-party data sharing or collection
- User has full control and ownership
- Backup files are the user's responsibility to secure
