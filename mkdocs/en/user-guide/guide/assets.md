# Assets

Assets represent individual investments in your portfolio — stocks, bonds, ETFs, crypto, cash accounts, or anything else you want to track. Each asset belongs to a category, is associated with a platform, and has a currency.

## Asset List

The left side of the Assets view shows all your assets. You can toggle between two grouping modes using the button in the toolbar:

- **By Platform** — groups assets under the broker or service where they're held.
- **By Category** — groups assets by their investment category.

Each row shows:

- Asset name
- Platform
- Category
- Latest value (with a currency badge if the asset isn't in your main currency)

Right-click an asset for a context menu. The **Delete** option is only available if the asset has no values recorded in any snapshot.

## Asset Detail

Select an asset to see its full detail on the right side.

### Properties

All properties are editable directly in the detail view:

- **Name** — the display name for the asset.
- **Platform** — choose from existing platforms or create a new one inline.
- **Category** — choose from existing categories or create a new one inline.
- **Currency** — select from the list of supported currencies.

### Value History

The value history section shows how the asset's value has changed over time.

- **Time range selector** — choose from **All**, **1Y**, **3M**, or **1M** to zoom in on a specific period.
- **Line chart** — a visual plot of the asset's value over time. Hover over any point to see a tooltip with the exact date and value.
- **Show Converted Value** toggle — this only appears for assets in a currency different from your main currency. When enabled, the chart switches to show values converted to your main currency, so you can see how exchange rate changes affected the value.
- **Value history table** — below the chart, a table lists every recorded value with columns for Date, Market Value, and Converted Value. Double-click or right-click any row to edit the value for that snapshot.

## Deleting Assets

Assets can only be deleted when they have **no values in any snapshot**. If the asset still has recorded values, the delete button will be disabled with an explanation.

To fully remove an asset:

1. Remove it from every snapshot where it appears (right-click the asset in each snapshot's breakdown and select **Remove**).
1. Once the asset has no snapshot values, you can delete it from the asset list.

!!! note

    Assets are typically created through CSV import or by adding them to a snapshot. You don't need to create assets separately — they're created on the fly when you first add them to a snapshot.
